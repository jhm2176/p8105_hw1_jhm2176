# Problem 1

First, I will load the penguin dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins") #load
```

## Data Overview

The data in this dataset includes information about penguins, measured
across 8 variables.

There are 344 observations (rows) and 8 variables (columns) in the data
set. Variables include species, island, bill length (mm), bill depth
(mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), sex, and year.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047 mm.

## Scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() #plot
```

![](p8105_hw1_jhm2176_files/figure-gfm/scatter-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf") #save
```

This scatterplot displays the relationship between bill length (mm) and
flipper length (mm) for penguins in the data set, color coded by
species. Overall, the scatterplot displays a moderately strong, positive
relationship between bill length and flipper length among penguins in
our data set.

# Problem 2

For this problem, I will first create a data frame comprised of:

-   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
-   a character vector of length 10
-   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
p2_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_lv = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("low", "medium", "high", "high", "low", "medium", "medium", "low", "high", "medium"),
  vec_fac = factor(vec_char, levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
  )
```

Now I will try to take the mean of each variable:

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.306029

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, norm_samp_lv))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_fac))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, vec_fac)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Using this code, I can see the mean of the random sample (norm_samp) and
logical vector (norm_samp_lv). These are -0.4 and 0.3, respectively.
This code does **not** work for the character vector (vec_char) and
factor vector (vec_fac) because these variables are not numeric or
logical.
