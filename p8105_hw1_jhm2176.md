## Problem 1

First, I will load the “penguins” dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins") #load
```

### Data Overview

The data in this dataset includes information about penguins, measured
across 8 variables.

There are 344 observations (rows) and 8 variables (columns) in the data
set. Variables include species, island, bill length (mm), bill depth
(mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), sex, and year.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047 mm.

### Scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() #plot
```

![](p8105_hw1_jhm2176_files/figure-gfm/scatter-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf") #save
```

This scatterplot displays the relationship between bill length (mm) and
flipper length (mm) for penguins in the data set, color coded by
species. Overall, the scatterplot displays a moderately strong, positive
relationship between bill length and flipper length among penguins in
our data set.

## Problem 2

For this problem, I will first create a data frame comprised of:

-   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
-   a character vector of length 10
-   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
p2_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  vec_log = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("low", "medium", "high", "high", "low", "medium", "medium", "low", "high", "medium"),
  vec_fac = factor(vec_char, levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
  )

print(p2_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    norm_samp vec_log vec_char vec_fac
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>   <chr>    <fct>  
    ##  1     1.57  TRUE    low      low    
    ##  2     1.43  TRUE    medium   medium 
    ##  3    -0.553 FALSE   high     high   
    ##  4     1.51  TRUE    high     high   
    ##  5    -0.383 FALSE   low      low    
    ##  6    -0.444 FALSE   medium   medium 
    ##  7    -0.713 FALSE   medium   medium 
    ##  8    -1.57  FALSE   low      low    
    ##  9     0.724 TRUE    high     high   
    ## 10    -0.639 FALSE   medium   medium

### Variable Means

Now I will try to take the mean of each variable:

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.09314456

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_log))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_fac))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, vec_fac)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Using this code, I can generate the mean of the numeric vector
(norm_samp) and logical vector (vec_log). This code does **not** work
for the character vector (vec_char) and factor vector (vec_fac).

### Converting Variables

In some cases, R can explicitly convert variables from one type to
another. Here I will apply the *as.numeric()* function to the logical,
character, and factor variables:

``` r
as.numeric(p2_df$vec_log)
as.numeric(p2_df$vec_char)
as.numeric(p2_df$vec_fac)
```

The *as.numeric()* function successfully converts the logical (vec_log)
and factor vectors (vec_fac) into numeric vectors. The character vector
(vec_char) does not convert successfully and results in a string of
“NA”.

This helps explain my results above when taking means for each variable
in the {r means} code chunk. It did **not** work for the character
vector and factor vector because these variables were not numeric or
logical. After coercion, however, the mean of the converted factor
vector can be taken and is returned as 2.
