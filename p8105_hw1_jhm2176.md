# Problem 1

First, I will load the penguin dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins") #load
```

## Data Overview

The data in this dataset includes information about penguins, measured
across 8 variables.

There are 344 observations (rows) and 8 variables (columns) in the data
set. Variables include species, island, bill length (mm), bill depth
(mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), sex, and year.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047 mm.

## Scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_jhm2176_files/figure-gfm/scatter-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf")
```

This scatterplot displays the relationship between bill length (mm) and
flipper length (mm) for penguins in the data set, color coded by
species. Overall, the scatterplot displays a moderately strong, positive
relationship between bill length and flipper length.

# Problem 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too! The mean is NA.
