# Problem 1

Here I will load the penguin dataset:

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
print(penguins)
```
The data in this dataset includes information about penguins. Variables include species, island, bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), sex, and year. There are 344 observations (rows) and 8 variables (columns) in the data set.

The mean flipper length is `r mean(penguins$x5, na.rm = TRUE)` mm.

# Problem 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(penguins$x5)`.
